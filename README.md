## Usage

**Objective:**

Your goal is to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts.

**Guessing:**

Enter your five-letter guess, and the game will provide feedback:

Correct letters in the correct position are displayed in green.
Correct letters in the wrong position are displayed in yellow.
Incorrect letters are displayed in white.
Strategy: Use the feedback from each guess to refine your next attempt. Deductive reasoning and word association skills are your best allies.

**Winning:** 

If you guess the word within six attempts, you win! If not, the game will reveal the hidden word.
