# Wurtle

**Objective:**

The goal is to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts.

**Guessing:**

Enter your five-letter guess, and the game will provide feedback:

Correct letters in the correct position are displayed in green.
Correct letters in the wrong position are displayed in yellow.
Incorrect letters are displayed in white.

Use the feedback from each guess to improve your next attempt.

**Winning:** 

If you guess the word within six attempts, you win! If not, the game will reveal the hidden word. Whether you win or lose, you will have the option to replay the game.
